# Modern Motion Body Lab

Angular 22 website for busy professionals, nurses, executives, and frequent travelers. Navy, ivory, coral, and teal styling, full-color gym photography, and original-color social logos.

## Local testing — macOS / zsh

Install Python 3.9+ and Node.js 24 LTS (24.15+), then run from this folder:

```sh
./local-start.sh
./local-stop.sh
```

Start creates/reuses `.venv`, checks Python requirements, installs Angular packages from the lockfile, builds the app, starts a background local server, and opens **http://localhost:4200**. Use `./local-start.sh --no-browser` to skip the browser. Python uses standard-library modules only. Node is required to compile Angular. The launcher uses pnpm if available or obtains pinned pnpm through npm.

## Windows / PowerShell

```powershell
.\local-start.ps1
.\local-stop.ps1
```

PowerShell scripts require PowerShell; use `.sh` files in macOS zsh. `-NoBrowser` skips opening the browser. Both launchers load `.env`, creating it from `.env.example` when missing. Defaults are `HOST=localhost` and `PORT=4200`. Configuration and runtime files are not published.

The scripts serve the compiled Angular app. After editing source, rerun start to rebuild. For automatic refresh during development, first stop the background preview, then use:

```sh
npx --yes pnpm@11.19.0 install --frozen-lockfile
npm start
```

Stop this foreground dev server with Ctrl+C. Do not run both servers on port 4200 simultaneously.

## Source structure

- `src/app/app.component.html`: page, phone/address placeholders, and enquiry form.
- `src/app/app.component.ts`: Angular form validation and submission behavior.
- `src/app/contact.config.ts`: public recipient and FormSubmit endpoint.
- `src/styles.css`: responsive design.
- `public/assets/`: photos and locally stored brand logos.
- `scripts/`: local environment setup and preview server.
- `build/modern-motion/browser/`: generated production output (ignored by Git).

Phone: (281) 703-9810. Instagram, YouTube, Threads, TikTok, and Facebook link to the supplied profiles. Studio address and Snapchat remain placeholders.

## Enquiry emails

The form submits to **https://formsubmit.co/ajax/modernmotionbodylab@gmail.com**. Valid submissions include name, email, optional phone, training interest, and message. The form validates required fields, blocks repeated clicks while sending, preserves input after failures, and includes a honeypot.

**Required activation:** Submit an enquiry from the deployed site, then open the activation email from FormSubmit in `modernmotionbodylab@gmail.com` and confirm it. Check Spam too. Until activation is complete, email delivery is not verified. After activation, submit a fresh enquiry and confirm receipt and reply-to behavior. FormSubmit owns email delivery; GitHub Pages cannot run an email server.

Browser tests use mocked service responses; they do not send real enquiries or claim that email was delivered. No Gmail password or private API key belongs in Angular source or `.env`. Visitors’ form details are sent to FormSubmit to forward the enquiry; the form discloses this.

Service documentation: https://formsubmit.co/ajax-documentation and https://formsubmit.co/help.

## GitHub Pages

Repository: https://github.com/modernmotionbodylab/mmbl

The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` installs locked dependencies, builds Angular with the repository base path, and deploys only `build/modern-motion/browser` through GitHub Pages. Changes pushed to `main` trigger deployment.

In GitHub **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub Actions**. The workflow needs Pages enabled and permission to deploy. The expected project URL is https://modernmotionbodylab.github.io/mmbl/; check the Actions deployment result to confirm it is live.

To reproduce the hosted build:

```sh
npx --yes pnpm@11.19.0 exec ng build --base-href /mmbl/
```

`npm run build` builds for a root URL such as the local preview. `npm run check` checks TypeScript. The application is one page with section anchors, so it needs no server-side route rewrites.

## Brand assets

Social brand SVGs: [SVGL](https://github.com/pheralb/svgl), MIT license (copy in `public/assets/social/LICENSE.txt`). Brand marks remain trademarks of their respective owners.

The earlier static implementation in `dist/`, `scripts/serve.mjs`, and the former hosting metadata are retained for reference. They are not Angular source and are not used by the GitHub Pages workflow. Edit `src/` and `public/` for the current website.

Threads SVG: Simple Icons 13.21.0, CC0 collection (https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/tree/13.21.0). Threads uses its native black brand mark.

Online and in-person subscription destinations are configured in `src/app/subscription.config.ts`. Empty URLs display “coming soon”; set them to the actual checkout URLs when available.
